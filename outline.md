For today's assignment, I've chosen to work on my logic writing skills. After reviewing the objectives for today, I think the best way for me to work on this weakness is create and test practice logic in javascript (also, my weakest language). The idea of this exercise is to prepare for interview questions as well as just feeling more confident overall in my ability to solve basic problems independently.

My outline for today is as follows:
1) Research common questions used in technical interviews
2) Create a webpage with those problems, similar to a quiz.
3) Write the logic on the backend to solve them
4) Check answers by running tests
5) Create frontend to webpage to submit answers
6) Program responds to whether or not given answer is correct
